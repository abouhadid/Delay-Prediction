# Delay-Prediction
Advanced ML Techniques Final Project @ Dauphine University

-------------------------------------------------------------
This project aims to predict flight delays during takeoff and landing with minute-level precision. The goal is to determine whether there will be a delay and accurately predict the duration of the delay.
